Toolbox v0.52
-------------

By default, all the routines in the module are imported into your namespace.

This module should work on any standard Perl distribution (it was even tested
on MacPerl), since it uses only relatively standard modules (the most exotic one
it uses is Net::SMTP).

To install, execute the following commands (preferably as root):

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	
That should be it.

Documentation is in POD format inside each module (type 'perldoc Toolbox::Simple' 
or 'perldoc Toolbox::CryptOTP' at the command line to read it).

My PGP public key is included with this distribution as "PGPkey.asc".
